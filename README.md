# 🌐 SEIC - Accessibility Tools Demo

## 📌 Project Overview
SEIC is a browser-based demo application that combines simple AI models with computer vision to assist people with hearing and visual impairments. This project showcases two main features: sign language recognition and color analysis.

- The AI models are basic demonstrations trained using Google Teachable Machine
- Accuracy is limited (sign language basic demo version by Teachable Machine ~50-60%, color detection ~90%)
- Designed as a proof-of-concept, not for production use

## 🖥️ Tech Stack
